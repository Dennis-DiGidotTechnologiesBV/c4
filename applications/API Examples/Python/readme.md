## About
This is an example that shows how the API interacts with the DiGidot Controller using Python 3.

## Usage

* Download the file
* Check if you have Python 3 installed. For windows, open a command prompt by clicking **Start** -> Type **cmd** -> type **py**. For Mac, python is installed by default.
* If it says something like 'is not regonized as an internal or external command...' then you need to install Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* After installing, hold down the left **SHIFT** key and right click anywhere in the folder.
* Choose: **Open command prompt or open Powershell window**
* type **py python_api.example.py**

## User parameters and in-dept
This example also works if you want to use accounts on the DiGidot Controller. If you open the .py file, in the first 30 lines, there are some user parameters and some extra explanation how the API works.
