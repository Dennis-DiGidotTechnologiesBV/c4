How to use:

1. In the same directory of "SceneUpgrade.exe" create a folder called "scenes" and "upgraded"
2. Place the old scene files in the "scenes" folder
3. Open the "SceneUpgrade.exe"
4. The program will try to upgrade the scenes and stores them in the "upgraded" folder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: 110 upgrade failed
This error can occur when the size of the header and the file is not the same. This could
be a problem, but most of the times it will still work when uploaded to the C4.
