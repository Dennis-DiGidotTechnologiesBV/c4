## Changelog ‚Äì DiGidot C4 Firmware v3.0.4 Beta 1  **Published: May 28, 2025**

### üîß Changed
- **Fader Tool**: Now also displayed when using a Live version.  
- **Record Processing**: Now shows progress percentage and estimated time remaining (ETA) when applying effects to recordings or saving to the SD card.  
- **Triggers**: Prompt now appears again for input device selection when creating a trigger across multiple devices.  
- **Scene Preview**: Previewing a scene before saving now stores it temporarily (not added to the scene list until explicitly saved). A stop button has been added to allow cancellation of the preview from the generation page.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- **Analog Trigger (Low)**: Default parameter "between dimmer values" is now correctly selected when using 0‚Äì10V analog input.  
- **Getting Started Wizard (Low)**: Fixed an inverted toggle when identifying devices by output state. Also corrected inconsistent behavior when navigating back and forth through the wizard.  
- **Web App (Low)**: Missing icons (clipboard, edit, delete) have been restored.  
- **Recording Playback (Low)**: The play/stop preview functionality now operates as expected.  
- **Action List (Low)**: Counter trigger is now correctly recognized when editing an action list.
