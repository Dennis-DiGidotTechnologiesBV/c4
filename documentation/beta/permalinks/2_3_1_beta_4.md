## Changelog for DiGidot Controller Firmware v2.3.1 (Beta 4) - Published on 29 of April 2022 ##

### Improved ###
* JSON file parsing: The DiGidot controller now actively shows an error (red light on the controller and create an error log entry) if any JSON file (trigger/ configuration etc.) failed to read correctly.
* FPS monitor: Both the input and output FPS counter are rewritten and now shows much more accurate numbers on the Monitor and Diagnosic page.

### Fixed ###
* (Medium) UX: Due to a bug that was introduced in Beta 2, the login screen will always prompt for an username and password after the first time. This has been resolved with this build.
* (Medium) sACN: Streaming ACN now works correctly when synchronisation is enabled.
