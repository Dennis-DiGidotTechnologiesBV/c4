## Changelog for DiGidot Controller Firmware v2.2.2 Beta 3 - Published on 23 November 2021 ##

### Added ###
* Triggers: There is now a third category for trigger on which type of device the action of the trigger is executed: "On input device". This will write a universal MAC-address in the file so the trigger can be easily copied over to different devices without any changes.
* 
### Changed ###
* Triggers: When creating a trigger, the default output device always was 'All Devices' which gave a side effect of always broadcasting the trigger, even if there's only a single device. Now when creating a trigger when only one device is selected, the action will be executed on that device only. And if the trigger is configured on multiple devices (e.g. a group), the action will only be performed on the device itself.

### Fixed ###
* Low (Triggers): When saving a trigger with, on the input, a group of devices, it will now be shown correctly at the trigger overview page.
