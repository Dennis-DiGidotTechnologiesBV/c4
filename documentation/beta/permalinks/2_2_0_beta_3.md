## Changelog for DiGidot C4 Firmware v2.2.0 Beta 3 - Published on 17 April 2021 ##

### New ###
* Triggers: It's now possible for the play and stop action of a scene, to specify a layer number. This way, scenes can still be played in the background while other scenes take priority.

### Added ###
* UX: Password can now be set when trying to exit from the "Playlist" page.

### Changed ###
* Manual: The manual has been updated with all the new features in this version like RDM, sACN, playback on different layers and many more.

### Improved ###
* Backup/Restore: If you've configured a WiFi password, for either Accesspoint or Client mode, it will be stored encrypted in a backup file, and can also be restored from a backup file.
* FPS: The C4 now reports the incoming FPS from only the active inputs (Art-Net/sACN).
* Input/Output: The API commands to get the input and output data is now more efficient and only gives the whole input/output back when the watcher is active
* UX: A lot of information text has been rewritten to make it more clear. 
* UX: After you've recorded a scene, the crossfade slider now has more precise control and you can set the fade value manually with a text field.
* UX: With triggers, if you have a brightness or alpha slider as a option, it now has 20 steps to make it more easy to select values like 5%, 10%, 15% etc.

### Fixed ###
* RDM: When doing a regular discover, it can nog longer result in a "Freeze".
* UX: On the Output Limiter page, the global limiter is now properly linked to the individual limiters of the device.
* UX: Time Period and cron has beed updated with new controls and are more stable.
