## Change log for DiGidot Controller Software Firmware v3.0 - Beta 1 - Published on 23 of January 2025 ##

##### New #####
* **Refined User Interface**: We've upgraded our core UX component, to the next version. This results in a more sleek and fresher look.

* **8 NEW LED IC's**: The following LED IC's have been added: HD107S, SK6805, SK6813, SK6851, SM16824, TM1903, UCS7804, WS2814

* **Port Labels**: The input/output configuration page now allows you to add a label to each output port of the controller. Just click, for example on 'Port D1' and enter your desired name.

* **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: If you're downloading or uploading large files, for example scenes, it could be a time consuming task. Now you can increase the speed of this by using FTP! The option can be found in Settings -> Developer Options (after enableing developer mode in Settings -> Interface).

* **Fader Tool**: Be in full control with the new fader tool. You can control each channel individually, with the help of faders. This fader can work on a single channel or a group of channels. 

* **OR and NOT triggering**: Instead of being restriced to only use the 'AND' operator, you can now use the 'OR'. In addition, that you can invert the trigger value with the 'NOT' operation.

* **1 click default color pallet generate**: With just a single click, you will be able to generate 7 presets (Red, Blue, Green, Magenta, Yellow, Orange, Lime) with RGB or 9 (+ White and Warm White) with RGBW.

* **40% faster startup time on an Extended controller**: The bootup time for an Extended controller, has been decreased from 5 to 3 seconds. 

* **Keyboard Shortcuts at generate scene page**: At the scene creation page, you can toggle the value to 0 and 255 by using the 'Spacebar' and go to the next, previous field by using the arrow keys 'Left' and 'Right'.

* **Clock accuracy improved**: For all the controllers that have been purchased since June 2024, the clock accuracy has been improved from 30 minutes of drifting, to only 1 minute per year!

* **Performance Assistant**: We've integrated a large portion of our Performance Guide, right into our Input/output configuration page. When you configure a LED IC, with some universes, you can directly see the maximum FPS, that can be archived with this specific configuration. 

* **New Action: Replay**: The new action 'Replay' allows you to continue playback after a power loss. If a scene was playing before power was cut, this scene will restart at boot and. If a playlist was playing, this will be restarted at the last scene where the power was cut.

* **Play a specific scene of a playlist**: If you choose 'Play Playlist' as a action, you can now specificy, which scene it should start from.

* **Compatible with our upcoming controllers**: This new update will be the heart of our new controller line-up, the C1 and PowerNode.


##### Changed #####
