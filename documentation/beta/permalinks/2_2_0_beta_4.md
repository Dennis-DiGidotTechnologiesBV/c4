## Changelog for DiGidot C4 Firmware v2.2.0 Beta 4 - Published on 20 April 2021 ##

### New ###
* Triggers: It's now possible for the play and stop action of a scene, to specify a layer number. This way, scenes can still be played in the background while other scenes take priority.

### Added ###
* UX: You can now set an 'Alpha' value for the scene and playlist 'play' trigger. 

### Changed ###
* Manual: The manual has been updated with all the new features in this version like RDM, sACN, playback on different layers and many more.


### Improved ###
* UX: When playing different scenes on different devices, the playerbar now saves which scene is playling so if you press the 'stop' and 'play' button after each other, it will resume where it left off.

### Fixed ###
* UX: Small fixes to some images and text from the manual
* UX: The 'copy to clipboard' feature on the UDP trigger page now correctly includes the start and end characters with it.
* UX: If you're highlighting a port and change the input protocol, the highlight button will be deseleted as the highlight feature is stopped when switching protocols.
* UX: When editing groups, the page will now be refreshed each time after you've edited one or muliltiple groups.
* UX: On the Input/Output config page, all fields won't allow comma values anymore.
