##### Changed #####
* UI: The license request to the register server has a higher timeout (100 instead of 15 seconds) for locations with many devices in a single network and/or with a low bandwidth.

##### Improved #####
* UI: When using the Safari browser on a iOS device, you can now download and upload files with the file browser. On all mobile platforms including iOS, and in the app, only uploading files is supported. For downloading files, you need to use a desktop/laptop.

##### Fixed #####
* Scenes: Sometimes, a unique ID of a scene map or scene input wasn't unique which leds to not playing the actual scene. This has been fixed now.
