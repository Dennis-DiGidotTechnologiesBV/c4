## Changelog for DiGidot Controller Firmware v2.3.1 (Beta 1) - Published on 25 of February 2022 ##

### New ###
* LED IC TM1934
* Parallel Load devices: With the release of the PxLNet Node, we saw the need to improve our total loading time, especially when you connect multiple devices to each other. With this feature, the load time is dramatically reduced if all devices has it's own IP-address. Before, if you had 20 devices, and each device required 5 seconds to load, the total loading time would be 100 seconds. 
With this update, the total time will be reduced to the loading time of about 1 device, which is 5 seconds.

### Improved ###
* Art-Net: If the input/output configuration only contains Art-Net universes to listen on, sACN will now be completely disabled  instead of going to stand-by mode. This way, if only Art-Net is used on the DiGidot controller, but in the same network, sACN is used for something else, performance degradation is prevented.
* Memory allocation: If the DiGidot controller needs to allocate some memory, for example, when creating a trigger, the function that is responsible for actually checking if the requested memory is available, wasn't working properly and gave no error back so the function, that requested memory, thinks that the memory is available but it's not. This could let to some random crashes (red/white status LED) that weren't traceable. This has been resolved now.
* UX: The network page has been completely rewritten so a lot of small UX bugs have been fixed with this.
* UX: On the Device page, while getting the time, the Daylight Saving Time (DST) parameter will also be shown.

### Changed ###
* Recording: Number of total different input universes is going up from 14 to 16 universes
* Recording: The warning with 'FPS too low' has changed to a note. It should be notified to the user that the recording could be more smooth this may not be possible in all situations. This will be displayed is the input FPS is below 35 instead of 50.
* UX: At the trigger page, when creating or editing a trigger, the number of (sub)devices is now correct, taking bays into account.

### Fixed ###
* WiFi: When switching the WiFi mode from Access Point to Client, it now returns the error 'password incorrect' instead of 'busy' or 'unknown'.
* Output API call: When requesting output data from a particular port, the DiGidot Controller doesn't crash anymore if the 'offset' is larger than the 'length' parameter.
* License: Fixed some bugs, and prevent an interface reload loop, if a temporary license is active.
* Getting Started: Now works again if you don't have a DiGidot C4 Extended in your network.
* Scene Generator (Beta): The preview function now works again.
