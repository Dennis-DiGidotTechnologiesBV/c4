For example: Previously, a UDP trigger name was 'start' then '!start#' had to be sent to trigger it. -> Now the trigger can have a name like 'Start UDP Red scene' and the  message can still be '!start#'.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Fixed</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scenes: Uploading and downloading of scenes now works correctly</li>\n<li>LED IC: Timing for WS2812B adjusted to compensate for the first LED flickering</li>\n<li>Scenes: Loop function now works correctly</li>\n<li>Trigger: Universe field of the Art-Net/DMX trigger now functions correctly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Various other bug-fixes and performance optimizations. bug-fixes and optimizations performed</p>\n</p>\n"
