## About this firmware 
This firmware adds the possibility to select a different protocol on D1+D2 than on D3+D4. So for example, you can output UCS9812 on port D1+D2 and WS2812 on D3+D4. It's however, not (yet) possible to have more than 2 different protocols on a single DiGidot controller. Also, the protocol on D1+D2 must match which also applies to D3+D4.
