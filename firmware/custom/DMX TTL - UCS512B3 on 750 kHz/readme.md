</div>

## About this firmware 
This firmware speeds up the output of a DMX TTL and UCS512B3 protocol. These protocols normally works on 250 kHz, the same as DMX. But many DMX-TTL (sometimes even DMX) and UCS512B3
protocols can go way faster than that. So in this firmware, the output frequency is changed from 250 to 750 kHz which gives you 3 times the FPS!. Keep in mind this firmware only
support these 2 LED IC's.

**This firmware is tested and suitable for a 24/7 operation**

## Usage

* Install the custom firmware. After that, you can select the DMX-TTL or UCS512B3 option and it will fly!
